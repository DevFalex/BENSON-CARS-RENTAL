# BENSON-CARS-RENTAL
A website to rent affordable cars online 

This website is a well functioning cars rental website built and designed with wordpress

# FRONTEND

The first file which is the "benson_cars_rental.wpress" contains everything about the website

To use it, install wordpress on your server
After installing wordpress and all is setup, go to plugins then search, install and activate the "All in One plugin"
When that is done, go to the all in one section at the side bar and click "import" 
search for this file "benson_cars_rental.wpress" and import it

When that is imported sucessfully, you can go online to check the frontend and how it looks like

NOTE: When setting up your wordpress, make sure you save the database as "wordpress"

# BACKEND
Go to your database, which in my case is "MySQL Database"
Click on the "wordpress" database
Look for "import" at the navbar at the top corner
Click on "Import" and choose the sql file name "wordpress"
Install it, by clicking Go

When installed, everything should be fine

Go to the car rentals website to see how it works

Cheers
